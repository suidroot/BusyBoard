# BusyBoard

The Busy board is a board designed for experimetning with various Microcontroller Dev boards. It is there to give you LEDs to make blink, various, buttons, switches and knobs to learn and test code against. The choice in components is based around what parts I have on hand and what is easily available in most beginers kits.


_Currently it has the following features_
* 4x LEDs
* 4x push buttons
* 8x DIP switches
* 1x Rotary Encorder
* 1x variable potentiometer
* Optional Pull up resistors (enabled by switch)
